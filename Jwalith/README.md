# UI Variations - Jwalith

This folder contains three different UI variations of the S&PAA Housing & Mental Health Resource Finder.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Download Just the Jwalith Folder (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/sczaction/housing/tree/main/Jwalith
2. Click the green **"Code"** button → **"Download ZIP"**
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Navigate to `Jwalith/ui-v1` (or `ui-v2` or `ui-v3`)
5. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser

Each version is **self-contained** and works independently. No server or additional setup needed!

## File Structure

Each version folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - Styling
- `script.js` - Application logic
- `assets/spaa-logo.png` - S&PAA logo
- `01_master_all_states.csv` - Service data
